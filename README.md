Points for scaling:

* Instead of having all questions on a single page with one timer, have each question appear one at a time, with a timer that moves on to the next question if the current one was not answered in the allotted time.

* Either at the end of each question's time, or after every question, the user should be shown which questions they answered correctly and which they answered incorrectly.
